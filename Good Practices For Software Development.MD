# Good Practices For Software Development

## What Did I Learn That Was New?

### 1. Communicating More
- It’s important to tell the team if I have internet or laptop issues. Usually, we don’t think about this, but it helps everyone.
- Using group chats instead of private messages is better because everyone can see and help.

### 2. Asking Better Questions
- When I ask for help, I should explain clearly with pictures, videos, or links.
- Big projects do this well, and I should follow their example.

### 3. Staying Focused
- "Work when you work, play when you play" is a great rule.
- I should block social media and use tools like **Boosted** to track my time.

## What Should I Get Better At? How Can I Improve?

### 1. Talking More with My Team
- Tell my team what I’m working on or if I have a problem.
- Use team chat instead of messaging one person, so everyone knows what’s happening.
- Keep my video on in meetings to connect better with my team.

### 2. Working Without Distractions
- Use **Freedom** to block social media while working.
- Turn off notifications that are not important.
- Plan my day with work time, break time, and food time.

### 3. Making Friends at Work
- Join meetings a little early to talk casually.
- Have short calls with teammates to understand how they work.

This way, I can work better and feel more connected with my team!
