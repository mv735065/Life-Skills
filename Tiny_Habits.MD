**Question 2. How does B = MAP help us form habits? What do M, A, and P mean?**

- B = MAP stands for Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt.  
- To form habits:  
  - **M (Motivation):** Link the habit to something meaningful or rewarding.  
  - **A (Ability):** Keep the habit simple and easy to do.  
  - **P (Prompt):** Use reminders or cues to trigger the habit.  
- Example: Drink more water by keeping a bottle nearby (prompt), starting with small sips (ability), and thinking about health benefits (motivation).

**Question 3. Why is it important to "Celebrate" after completing a habit?**

- Celebrating makes us feel good and creates a positive emotional connection to the habit.  
- Positive emotions make the habit easier to stick with over time.

**Question 5. What does the book say about identity and habits?**
