# Dealing with Sexual Harassment

## What is Sexual Harassment?

Sexual harassment is any kind of behavior that is **unwanted** and makes someone feel uncomfortable or unsafe. This can happen in many ways, including:

- **Inappropriate touching** or making uncomfortable physical contact.
- **Making sexual jokes** or comments, or sharing things that are offensive.
- **Sending unwanted messages** or images, especially of a sexual nature.
- **Pressuring someone** to do something in exchange for benefits like promotions or raises.
- **Invading someone's personal space** or blocking their way.

## What to Do If You Face or See Harassment

If you experience or witness sexual harassment, here are some steps you can take:

1. **Speak Up**: Politely but firmly tell the person to stop their behavior. Let them know that what they are doing is not acceptable.
   
2. **Write It Down**: Keep a record of what happened, including the date, details of the behavior, and any witnesses who saw it. This can be helpful later.

3. **Report It**: Tell someone you trust about the situation, such as a manager, HR, or a committee set up to handle these issues. Reporting it can help stop the behavior.

4. **Get Support**: Talk to friends, family, or a counselor to help you deal with the situation and feel supported.

## Conclusion

Speaking out about sexual harassment can help stop it from happening to you or others. By taking action and supporting each other, we can make sure everyone feels safe and respected.
